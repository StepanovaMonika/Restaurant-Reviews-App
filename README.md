# Restaurant Reviews App

This project is part of Udacity's FEND.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to convert a static website into a responsive one, add accessibility features and a service worker to create a seamless offline experience for users.

## How to run the application

1. Download or clone this repository and unzip the files. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V` or `python --version` depending on the version. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use). For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `python -m http.server 8000`. 

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
